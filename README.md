# Heart-Disease-Predictor
## Overview
Predicting heart-disease using machine learning (Classification)
This notebook will look into using Python-based ML and data science libraries in an attempt to build a ML model capable of predicting whether someone has heart disease or not based on their medical record.

The problem will be divided in these different sections:

1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features 
5. Modelling 
6. Experimentation

## Technologies used:
* Scikit-Learn
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
